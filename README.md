# INTRO-collaborative
Comparison between expert and GPT
This is a co-workshop between EMOO Wang and Simin Liu on LLMs. In this project, we each generate a PPT on a topic we know and the topic the other know but I don't know.
We will generate PPT of topic we don't know with the help of GPT 3.5.
This is a real fight between human wisdom and AIs!
